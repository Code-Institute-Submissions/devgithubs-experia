## Objective
This Website was created for the purpose of implementing a fullstack Django framework website with Stripe payment integration.
The project allows users to explore a range of different experiences, purchase them, and also create their own unique experiences available for purchase. The website was built using Bootsrap (HTML, CSS), JS, Python, Django, Stripe, AWS S3.

## UX & Design

## Strategy

#### Project Goal
The project goal or 'use case' of the website is to act as a platform where people can browse and purchase unique experiences in their own city or perhaps a city that they plan on visiting. There is also an option for a user to create their own unique experiences which they can make available for purchase.

The project is also to give me experience building a full stack e-Commerce website that handles payments.
